# Project Overview
This is a customer churn dataset that was downloaded from Kaggle, and it contained information about customer demographics and account records for a financial institution.
I performed the data preparation and visualization using Microsoft Excel.

## Techniques Used
.  Data cleaning and preparation 

.  Exploratory Data Analysis

.  Data Visualisation

## Data Insights 

Using EDA, there are total of 10,000 customers and 2,038 left. The countries, typical tenure and age group of the churned customers were captured.
The number of products purchased by customers is also highlighted to know if high value customers are at risk.
Then the satisfaction and complain scores are also captured to address likely pain points.

## Recommendations

General enhancements of products and services to meet all the customers need is required.
